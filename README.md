# WafferFaultDetection

This project is used to detect faulty waffers and alert the user for repair and diagnosis.

## Description

- It uses a real life dataset from a company that manufactures waffers
- The user has to enter the waffer data in a csv format.
- The data gets validated, preprocessed and predicitons are made on it.
- The prediction file is exported in a csv format ( +1 = good, -1 = bad)
- The application is also able to train itself using the dataset it has.
- Clustering was used to cluster similar data then made predictions on it.
- The application can be deploy on an ec2 instance.

## Aim / Goal

- To detect faulty waffers so that they can be identified in time and replaced.

## Skillset

- Python programming.
- Data Validation
- Data preprocessing
- feature engineering
- model creation

- logging.
- clustering methodology for better model building.
- data science lifecycle
- model retraining approach
- deployment on aws.
